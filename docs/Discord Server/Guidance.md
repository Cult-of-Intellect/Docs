- **For @Support Staff & @Moderation Staff roles**

---

## Responsibility

---

- **No misuse or abuse of permissions** (e.g., randomly disconnecting, muting, or moving others in voice channels).  
- For staff, instead of resigning, request **@Administrative Leave**. You're not a slave and should prioritize your problems. This does not mean abusing administrative leave to avoid your duties.  
- It's **your responsibility to take care of your account and identity**. Best practices:  
  - Do not click on random links.  
  - Avoid downloading unnecessary software, especially free or suspicious ones.  
  - Steer clear of software by individuals hostile towards COI or its principles.

---

## Maturity & Morals

---

- **Avoid indulging in widely inappropriate jokes** or conversations (e.g., pedophilia).  
- Avoid large-scale argumentsâ€”**not every action needs a reaction**.  
- You are the example: **be mature, respectful, and abide by the server rules** in chats and voice channels.  
- **Avoid roleplaying as a creep** or weirdo, even for entertainment. **Jokes do not mask negative judgment**.

---

## Integrity

---

- **Respect the privacy and confidentiality of others** (e.g., DMs, private information shared in tickets or private messages).  
- Be loyal to the Cult of Intellect:  
  - For staff: **this means not working for other communities**.  
  - For helpers: **this means not using your power to undermine COI**.

---

## Reasonability & Leverage

---

- For staff: **unless there is a strong violation of a rule**, avoid punishing members.  
- Be reasonable with the punishments you give (e.g., mute times, ban lengths, warns).  
  - **Exception**: NSFW violations.
