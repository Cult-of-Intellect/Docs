# Initial Setup Guide

So, you have just purchased DX9WARE. These are the required steps to configure your PC to run DX9WARE without any problems.
If you fail to complete all of these steps, you can expect to see errors.

## Ensuring Maximum Security

:::danger
If you would like to ensure maximum security to protect yourself from bans and detections:

- Make sure no other kernel anti-cheats are running on your computer.
- After you're done using DX9WARE, restart your system.

:::

## 1. Ensure your windows account is an administrator

It is important that your windows account is an administrator and can run the loader without needing to enter a different username & password.

## 2. DX9WARE Anti-Virus Exclusions

These folders must be excluded from your anti-virus:

1. The folder containing your `loader.exe` and `updater.exe`.
2. The `%appdata%\dx9ware` folder. If you don't see the folder, create it.

We have provided instructions below on adding these exclusions with Windows Defender.

If you are using a third-party antivirus, it will look different, however the same idea applies.
