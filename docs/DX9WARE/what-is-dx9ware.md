## What games are supported?

All of them - seriously. From the biggest games haunting the front page to the smallest ones, DX9WARE can support every one of them. This is thanks to the addition of DX9WARE LUA, which opens a plethora of doors leading to an infinite number of possibilities & control.

Note: most Roblox games work natively with DX9WARE; however, on games with custom models, you will need to add support manually either by making your own DX9WARE LUA script or by using someone else's found in our massive library.
