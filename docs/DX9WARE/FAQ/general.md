# General

<details>
    <summary>What games are supported?</summary>
  
    **All of them - seriously.** From the biggest games haunting the front page to the smallest ones, DX9WARE can support every one of them. This is thanks to the addition of DX9WARE LUA, which opens a plethora of doors leading to an infinite number of possibilities & control.

    :::note
    Most ROBLOX games work natively with DX9WARE; however, on certain games with custom models, you will need to add support manually either by making your own DX9WARE LUA script or by using someone else's found in our library.

    We do our best to add native support for popular custom model games such as Phantom Forces.

    It is always best to create a ticket and ask in our [discord server](https://cultofintellect.com/discord) if you would like to check if a particular game is supported.

    <summary>Do I need an executor?</summary>
    
    **No.**
    DX9WARE is not a script, it's it's own executable & comes with its own injector, making it a great, budget-friendly option for those new to the exploiting scene.

    <summary>Can I inject scripts?</summary>

    **No, & yes.** DX9WARE does have a LUA executor but it only supports DX9WARE specific functions around AIMLOCK & ESP.

    <summary>What do I need to run it?</summary>

    Fortunately, DX9WARE is very optimized so you don't need one of those $20,000 streamer setups you see on YouTube.

    - Be able to run ROBLOX at a stable FPS.
    - Administrator permissions on your PC (for anti-virus exclusions)
    - A stable internet connection.
    - Windows 10 or higher.

  <summary>Will I get banned?</summary>

    You can enjoy DX9WARE on any game you wish to dominate without care of being banned; however, though DX9WARE cannot be detected, suspicious aim or features can.

    :::note
    You will always be at risk of a ban from another player reporting you. ðŸ™‚

  <summary>How do I hide DX9WARE from recordings?</summary>

1. Make sure no other exploits are running in the background
2. Inject DX9WARE
3. After DX9WARE has fully injected, record the Roblox window only
4. Flaunt to your viewers that you're an absolute unit at the game & they'll have all the proof to believe it but zero proof to dispute it. Unless you're rage cheating, of course - might as well skip this entire process because it's not gonna make a difference if your intent isn't to appear legit.

### Display Capture

If you are using dispaly capture, enable the **display proof** setting in the **Extra** tab.
This will hide it from Display Capture too.

:::note
If you can still see DX9WARE in your stream, retry the steps but fully close the recording platform of choice before injecting DX9WARE.
