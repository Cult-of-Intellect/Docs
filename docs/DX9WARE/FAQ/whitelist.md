# Whitelist System

DX9WARE's uses a **username & password** whitelist system only allows **one PC** to be used as the dedicated PC for that account.
DX9WARE makes use of a HWID (Hardware ID) for that dedicated PC and ties this to your account. If you try and login from another device, you will receive an error:

![HWID Mismatch](/img/hwid-mismatch.png)

You can _'clear'_ your HWID to login on a new device once every `7` days through the [dashboard](https://dashboard.cultofintellect.com)

## What's a Hardware ID?

    Your DX9WARE HWID is your unique license to the software & is used for whitelisting purposes. It consists of information from your system & Windows install.

    The HWID changes when adding/removing computer parts & upon every operating system reset.
