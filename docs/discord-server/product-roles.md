# I bought a product, can I get a buyer role in the discord?

Yes! If you have bought from us, and want roles in the discord:

1. Firstly, [connect your discord account](/discord-server/link-discord-account)
2. Once connected, in the discord server run the `/roles` command.

3. The bot will automatically check your account and if you have an active subscription, roles will be applied.
